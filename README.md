  Hi!<br/>
  I created this website to share my progress in learning data analysis and visualization with interesting projects.<br/>
  Here are some of them:

   Irises üå∏

  <br/>
  
-------------------

<br/>

I created a chart in R which compares the sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width of various iris samples.

<br/>

- Sepal length _(blue)_ 
- Sepal width _(red)_
- Petal length _(green)_
- Petal width _(purple)_

<br/>

### Conclusion:

The sepals, which are, in most flowers, usually green and smaller with a more protective role, are in this case larger than the petals, as the graph shows. Both sepals and petals are large and colourful in irises, attracting and guiding many insects to their pollen.

<br/>

I created a heatmap in both Excel and R which represents the amount of contamination of plant tissue culture specimens by various pests.

### Conclusion:

The biggest contamination in all clones was caused by fungi, followed by bacteria.

  <br/>
  
-------------------------------------

<br/>

In this project I used Power BI to create several graphs which represent the current most accurate procedure of prognosing the appearance of Plasmopara viticola and other, similar fungi.

<br/>

### Procedure:

Each day we will measure and calculate the sum of the average daily temperature, the incubations and the incubation period by average temperature. Those will provide us with new information every day on when the incubation period will end. May 25 was not taken into consideration as the temperature was below 12¬∞C that day.

_Image 3: Days until the end_

<br/>

### Conclusion:

The prognosis, as days go by, continues to suggest that the incubation period will end on May 28 and that the conidium will appear during the night between May 28 and May 29 if the requiring conditions are met - T>12¬∞C and RH>85%.
In my country, Serbia, the protection is usually done after the second incubation period as the infections after the first incubation period are rare due to bad conditions for the formation of conidium.
